# Oye Car Web Application
Our MERN stack project is a dynamic web application that connects automobile buyers and sellers. Utilizing the latest web development technologies including the MongoDB database, Express.js framework, React.js library, and Node.js runtime environment, we have created an efficient and user-friendly platform that makes it easy for users to buy and sell cars and parts. Our app features a comprehensive database of cars and parts for sale, complete with detailed descriptions and photos. Buyers can easily search for specific cars or parts using our search filters and browse through listings until they find what they're looking for. Sellers can create their own listings, track sales, and communicate with buyers directly through our platform. We have also incorporated secure payment processing and other authentication and security measures to ensure that all transactions are safe and protected. Whether you're looking to buy or sell a car or parts, our MERN stack project offers a seamless and hassle-free experience for all users.
